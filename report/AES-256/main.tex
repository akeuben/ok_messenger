One of the core algorithms we implemented was AES-256. While the other algorithms in use provide 128-bit security,
it would have been sufficient to implement AES-128. However, as the main goal of this project was to explore cryptographic 
algorithms through their implementation, implementing AES-256 (with the more complicated key scheduling algorithm) provided 
greater learning experience. This does mean that our application does not provide 256-bit security (as AES-256 does), but rather 128-bit security.
However, as this is still considered secure as 128-bit security is considered secure today, this loss of security with this particular 
algorithm does not significantly harm the security of the overarching application.
