The effectiveness follows from two key properties of Double Ratchet: 
forward secrecy and break-in recovery.

\textbf{Definition (Forward Secrecy):} If an attacker manages to steal a key, they won't be able to 
retrieve old keys or decrypt previous messages.

\textbf{Definition (Break-in Recovery):} If an attacker manages to steal a key, they won't be able to 
retrieve future keys or decrypt later messages.

Double ratchet has these properties, as will be described below. As such, as a new key is generated 
for every message, even if a key were to be stolen, that key would only work on one message, providing great 
security to the users and the system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the protocol.
